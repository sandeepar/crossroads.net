description: "For thousands of years, the Jewish people waited for Him--the Son of the King-to come set them free. He became a legend whispered through the generations--a riddle recited by the mystics. Some wondered if He was the invention of wishful thinking, or if he would ever arrive. Join us as we uncover the mystery and character of the long-awaited Son."
