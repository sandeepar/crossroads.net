<p class=\"noPspace\">We created Awaited so that our unchurched friends could hear God&rsquo;s story in a way that they could understand. So enjoy a show. Invite your friends. But take only what you need, so that we can share the Christmas story with as many people as possible. Shows run December 14-24 at Crossroads Oakley. Early tickets are available <a title=\"Awaited early tickets\" href=\"/earlytickets\">here</a>.</p>
